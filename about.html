            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer career
            Path, I've made the big jump to the Bootcamp to get expert code
            reviews of my Solo Projects and meet like-minded peers.

        <h3>How I stay commited to learning</h3>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
          and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
          learned or work new techiniques into existing projects.
          <br /><br />

          While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
          was learning and most things about my journey with the world
        </p>
        <h3>How I got started</h3>
        <p>
          I started to simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
          would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
          session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
          also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
          <br /><br />

          That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
          my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
          motivated.
